      "### Explanation\n",
      "1. **Initialize Pygame**: We initialize Pygame and set up the colors, screen dimensions, and display.\n",
      "2. **Player Class**: The Player class represents each player controlled by the user, with methods to draw, move, and expand territory.\n",
      "3. **Main Function**: The `main` function handles the game loop, player movements, collision detection, and drawing on the screen.\n",
      "4. **Event Loop**: Inside the loop, we check for key presses to move the players and handle collisions.\n",
      "5. **Win Condition**: If a player moves out of the screen bounds, the other player wins, and the game ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Running the Game\n",
      "1. Save the script to `territorial_pvp.py`.\n",
      "2. Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`.\n",
      "3. Run the script: `python territorial_pvp.py`.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a simple implementation to get you started. For a more complex and polished game, you would need to add more features like different types of actions, better graphics, and a more complex territory control mechanism.None"
